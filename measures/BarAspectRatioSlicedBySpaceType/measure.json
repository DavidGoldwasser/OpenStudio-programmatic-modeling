The resulting building will have a core and perimeter zoning, unless it is too small, in which case eac floor will have a single zone. This uses a floor multiplier for buildings taller than three stories. Below is an example of what the space tyep hash might look like. Sum of hash values should equal 1.0. \"{:189.1-2009 - Office - Corridor - CZ1-3 => '0.3', :189.1-2009 - Office - Conference - CZ1-3 => '0.2', :189.1-2009 - Office - ClosedOffice - CZ1-3 => '0.5' }\"",
